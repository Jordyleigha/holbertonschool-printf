<h2 align="center">Understanding the _printf Function and Conversion Specifiers<b></h2>

  Introduction:
  
In this project, we've utilized the _printf function, a custom implementation of the standard C printf function. This function allows precise control over the formatting of output. We'll get into this code and understand how it works, along with the our assigned conversion specifiers employed for different types of output.
